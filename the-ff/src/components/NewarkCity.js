            Founded in 1666 Newark, NJ is a City built on the foundations of entrepreneurship and creative power. Over three centuries later; it is still standing strong and experiencing a resurgence of the very foundations that make it one of the most historically famous cities in the nation. With the revitalization of industry and entrepreneurship it is paramount that our young people claim their stake. 87,000 Newark youth live within or below national poverty lines and 64% live in households headed by a single caregiver. More than ever, it is essential that we are exposing our youth to the ideas of building wealth through a life of fulfillment and social service as well as providing valuable mentorship opportunities for them to become the leaders of tomorrow.

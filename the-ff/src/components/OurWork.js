                  We have also developed a partnership with California based Real World Scholars which provides all of our student-run businesses a full scale administrative and e-commerce platform. Future Fownders has also partnered with local nonprofit, Schools That Can to develop the curriculum used for their STC 2017 Design Day Challenge and were also on hand to help facilitate the event hosted at the Audible headquarters.
